Breast Cancer Classification Using Supervised Learning
This project demonstrates the application of supervised learning techniques to classify breast cancer tumors as malignant or benign using the breast cancer dataset available in the sklearn library. The project is divided into three main components:

1. Loading and Preprocessing
Dataset: The breast cancer dataset from sklearn.datasets is used, which contains 569 samples with 30 features each and a binary target variable (malignant or benign).

Preprocessing Steps:

Handling Missing Values: The dataset is complete, so no missing value handling is required.

Feature Scaling: Features are standardized using StandardScaler to ensure all features contribute equally to the model's performance, especially for algorithms like SVM and k-NN.

Justification: Scaling is necessary to normalize the feature magnitudes, which improves the performance of distance-based algorithms.

2. Classification Algorithm Implementation
Five classification algorithms are implemented:

Logistic Regression:

A linear model for binary classification.

Suitable for this dataset due to its simplicity and effectiveness for binary outcomes.

Decision Tree Classifier:

A tree-based model that splits data based on feature values.

Suitable for handling non-linear relationships in the data.

Random Forest Classifier:

An ensemble of decision trees to reduce overfitting and improve generalization.

Suitable for complex datasets with many features.

Support Vector Machine (SVM):

Finds the optimal hyperplane to separate classes.

Suitable for high-dimensional data and binary classification.

k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN):

Classifies samples based on the majority class of their k-nearest neighbors.

Suitable for small to medium-sized datasets with non-linear relationships.

3. Model Comparison
The performance of the five algorithms is compared based on accuracy:

Logistic Regression: ~95% accuracy

Decision Tree: ~93% accuracy

Random Forest: ~96% accuracy

SVM: ~97% accuracy

k-NN: ~96% accuracy

Results:

Best Performing Algorithm: SVM (~97% accuracy)

Worst Performing Algorithm: Decision Tree (~93% accuracy)

Repository Structure
Code: The implementation of the project is available in the Jupyter Notebook or Python script.

Dataset: The breast cancer dataset is loaded directly from sklearn.datasets.

Requirements: Libraries used include scikit-learn, pandas, and numpy.


Conclusion
This project demonstrates the application of supervised learning techniques to classify breast cancer tumors. SVM performed the best, while Decision Tree had the lowest accuracy. The results highlight the importance of choosing the right algorithm for a given dataset.
